# To-Do Redux App

A simple To-Do application built with React and Redux. This app allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The application leverages Redux for state management to ensure that tasks are consistently managed across the app. It's a great starting point for learning React, Redux, and the Redux Toolkit.
